# Empty Limit
Empty Limit is a website dedicated to supplementing the learning of students in early (1-) category theory. We host accessible discussions of various concepts, using gorgeous interactive proofs to support them. This website is intended to be read *alongside* a conventional textbook, and is not intended to replace one.

I find Wikipedia a bit too sparse to reasonably support students learning introductory category theory. For the same demographic, the nLab is typically too dense. Empty Limit strikes a balance between these two.

# TODO LIST:

Port from old repository:
  - [x] `index.html`
  - [x] `style.css`
  - [x] `about.html`
  - [ ] `glossary.html`
  - [ ] `script/glossary.js`

  - [ ] `page-generation/*`
  - [ ] `buildPages.sh`

  - [ ] `discussion/*`
  - [ ] `proof/*`
  - [ ] `script/discussion.js`

Missing content:
  - [ ] More Discussion-family pages
    - [ ] Fill out the current glossary
  - [ ] More Proof-family pages
    - [ ] Add relevant proofs for the elements in the glossary

Missing functionality:
  - [ ] `inset` should update `script/glossary.js`'s list of all pages
