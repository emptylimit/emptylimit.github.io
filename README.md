# Empty Limit
Empty Limit is a website dedicated to supplementing the learning of students in early (1-) category theory. We host accessible discussions of various concepts, using gorgeous interactive proofs to support them. This website is intended to be read *alongside* a conventional textbook, and is not intended to replace one.

I find Wikipedia a bit too sparse to reasonably support students learning introductory category theory. For the same demographic, the nLab is typically too dense. Empty Limit strikes a balance between these two.

    -- Small Lean4 project (called `inset`) to represent Empty Limit's Discussion- and Proof-family pages, and
    -- to "render" them into HTML files.
    -- See `/page-generation/README.md` for more details.
  proof/
    -- Rendered HTML articles showcasing proofs for results in basic category theory.
    -- NEVER EDIT THIS DIRECTORY DIRECTLY. Allow it to be generated by `inset`; see `/page-generation/`.
  script/
    discussion.js   -- JS code to support the pages `/discussion/*.html` and `/proof/*.html`.

# TODO LIST:

Missing content:
  - [ ] More Discussion-family pages
    - [ ] Finish filling out `index.html`'s reading order first
    - [ ] Fill out the commented-out parts of the current glossary
  - [ ] More Proof-family pages
    - [ ] Add relevant proofs for the elements in the glossary

Missing functionality:
  - [ ] `inset` should update `script/glossary.js`'s list of all pages
  - [ ] `inset` should **REQUIRE** a list of (external) references at the bottom of each page
    - [ ] A small dictionary of known sources can be mantained in some `inset` source file so that full URLs etc don't need to be re-typed on each page
    - [ ] The current pages should be updated to list sources at the bottom
  - [ ] `inset` should support "Exercise" `.block-section-element`s
