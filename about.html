          About Empty Limit
        </h1>
        <p>
          Empty Limit is a website dedicated to supplementing the learning of students in early (1-) category theory. We host accessible discussions of various concepts, using interactive proofs to support them. This website is intended to be read <em>alongside</em> a conventional textbook (see our <a href="#recommended-reading">recommendations</a>), and is not intended to replace one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage">nLab</a>, this website is intended to be more accessible to introductory students. In contrast to <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, this website is intended to house more proofs than its articles. In contrast to a textbook, this website makes diagrammatic proofs interactive, so they feel richer and easier to connect with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empty Limit is written primarily with HTML and CSS, with JavaScript to control interactive features of the website. The HTML for each article is generated from human text using a Lean4 project. All artwork, writing and programming has been painstakingly done by us without the use of AI tools.

          <li>
            <a href="https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf"><em>Category Theory in Context</em></a> by Emily Riehl &mdash; A fantastic introductory book rich with great explanations and enlightening examples. Great if you want to commit to learning category theory from the very start. Much longer than the next entry on this list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09375"><em>Basic Category Theory</em></a> by Tom Leinster &mdash; A great introductory book with an increadible wealth of examples and insightful perspectives. Perfect if you want to quickly gain an understanding of various ideas in introductory category theory. Less comprehensive than the previous entry.
