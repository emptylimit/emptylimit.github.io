It is somewhat fruitless to think of large categories; for a different choice of the cardinal $\\kappa$ (which we immediately forgot about), some previously large categories may be small categories. In general, results that hold for small or locally small hold for slightly larger categories or those with slightly larger hom-sets if you pass to a larger inaccessible cardinal."

The hom-sets $\\mathsf{C}$ of a category $\\mathsf{C}$ are only ever required to be <em>collections</em> &mdash; a catch-all term to evade size issues. In particular, they need not form (small) sets. It is exactly the <em>locally small categories</em> for which the name 'hom-set' is not misleading."
