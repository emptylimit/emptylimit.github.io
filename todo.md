# Missing content:
  - [ ] More Discussion-family pages
    - [ ] Finish filling out `index.html`'s reading order first
    - [ ] Fill out the commented-out parts of the current glossary
  - [ ] More Proof-family pages
    - [ ] Add relevant proofs for the elements in the glossary

# Missing functionality:
  - [ ] `inset` should update `script/glossary.js`'s list of all pages
  - [ ] `inset` should **REQUIRE** a list of (external) references at the bottom of each page
    - [ ] A small dictionary of known sources can be mantained in some `inset` source file so that full URLs etc don't need to be re-typed on each page
    - [ ] The current pages should be updated to list sources at the bottom
  - [ ] `inset` should support "Exercise" `.block-section-element`s
